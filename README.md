# Gemini Canvas Previewer

A Chrome extension that adds a preview tab to Google Gemini Canvas.

In Gemini Canvas, the Preview view isn’t always available. Users have reported that the Preview button/tab can be missing or disappear in some sessions—especially when running Canvas inside a Gem or when files are attached (e.g., from Drive/knowledge).[^1][^2] This extension injects an HTML preview into Canvas panels where the native Preview UI is absent.

If a native preview tab already exists, the extension does nothing.

## Install

### Requirements

- Google Chrome

### Steps

1. Clone or download this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sammiya/gemini-canvas-previewer.git
```

2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `gemini-canvas-previewer` folder
6. The extension should now appear in the list

## Usage

1. Open [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Generate HTML code so that Canvas opens
3. If the native preview tab is missing, "Code" and "Preview" tabs are injected automatically
4. Click "Preview" to render the HTML
5. Click "Code" to return to the editor
6. While streaming, the Preview button is disabled
7. After streaming finishes, the preview updates automatically if it is visible

## Known Limitations

- **HTML only** The preview is injected only when the language is HTML
- **Fixed 500ms delay** A fixed delay is used to wait for Angular rendering and may be insufficient on some environments
- **iframe sandbox** The sandbox is more restrictive than the native preview (kept minimal for safety)

## Security and Disclaimer

- Use at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any damages caused by using this extension.
- This extension executes the HTML and JavaScript generated by Gemini. Do not preview untrusted content.
- `shim.html` is sandboxed but allows `allow-scripts` and `allow-downloads`. Be cautious about downloads and script execution.
